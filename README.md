# WeatherPy

## Overview

WeatherPy is a Python project designed to analyze the relationship between various weather parameters (temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed) and the latitude of cities around the globe. The project uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for over 600 cities, processes the data, and visualizes the results through scatter plots and linear regression analysis.

## Technologies Used

* **Python** : The main programming language for data collection and analysis.
* **OpenWeatherMap API** : Provides real-time weather data for cities around the world.
* **Pandas** : A powerful data manipulation library for Python, used to handle and process data.
* **NumPy** : A library used for mathematical and array operations.
* **Matplotlib** : A data visualization library used to generate scatter plots.
* **SciPy** : Used for performing linear regression analysis (specifically, `scipy.stats.linregress`).
* **Citipy** : A Python library used to determine city names based on geographic coordinates.

## Project Workflow

1. **Generating Random Geographic Coordinates:**
   * Random geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) are generated within specified ranges using NumPy.
   * The `citipy` library is used to map these coordinates to the nearest city.
2. **Retrieving Weather Data:**
   * The OpenWeatherMap API is used to fetch current weather data for each city. The weather data points retrieved include:
     * Maximum Temperature
     * Humidity
     * Cloudiness
     * Wind Speed
     * Latitude/Longitude
3. **Visualizing Relationships:**
   * Scatter plots are generated to examine the relationships between:
     * Latitude vs. Temperature
     * Latitude vs. Humidity
     * Latitude vs. Cloudiness
     * Latitude vs. Wind Speed
   * Linear regression is performed separately for cities in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres for each weather variable.
4. **Data Export:**
   * The processed data is exported into a CSV file for future analysis.

## Key Findings

* **Temperature vs. Latitude:**
  * There is a noticeable linear correlation between latitude and temperature in both hemispheres. As latitude increases in the Northern Hemisphere, temperature decreases, and in the Southern Hemisphere, temperature increases as you move closer to the equator. The R-squared values show a strong correlation.
* **Humidity vs. Latitude:**
  * There is no strong linear correlation between humidity and latitude in either hemisphere, as indicated by very low R-squared values.
* **Cloudiness vs. Latitude:**
  * Similar to humidity, the relationship between cloudiness and latitude does not exhibit a significant linear correlation in either hemisphere.
* **Wind Speed vs. Latitude:**
  * Wind speed also shows weak correlations with latitude. The R-squared values for both hemispheres indicate that wind speed is not strongly dependent on latitude.

## Data and Visualizations

### Scatter Plots:

* Scatter plots were created to visualize the relationship between weather variables and latitude. These plots are saved in the `output_data` folder:
  * `Fig1.png`: Latitude vs. Temperature
  * `Fig2.png`: Latitude vs. Humidity
  * `Fig3.png`: Latitude vs. Cloudiness
  * `Fig4.png`: Latitude vs. Wind Speed

### Linear Regression:

* Linear regression plots were generated for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres for each weather variable. These plots can be found in the `output_data` folder:
  * `NH_Temp_vs_Latitude.png`: Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
  * `SH_Temp_vs_Latitude.png`: Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
  * `NH_Humidity_vs_Latitude.png`: Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
  * `SH_Humidity_vs_Latitude.png`: Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
  * `NH_Cloudiness_vs_Latitude.png`: Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
  * `SH_Cloudiness_vs_Latitude.png`: Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
  * `NH_WindSpeed_vs_Latitude.png`: Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
  * `SH_WindSpeed_vs_Latitude.png`: Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude


## Conclusion

* **Temperature** has the strongest linear relationship with latitude.
* **Humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed** show weak or no linear correlations with latitude.
* This project highlights how temperature trends are directly influenced by latitude, while other weather variables seem less impacted.
